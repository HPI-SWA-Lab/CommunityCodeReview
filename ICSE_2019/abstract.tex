% Context: What is the broad context of the work? What is the importance of the general research area?
Code reviews play an important and successful role in modern software development. 
% Inquiry: What problem or question does the paper address? How has this problem or question been addressed by others (if at all)?
However, since they, in practice, happen only once before new code is merged into the main branch, there is no support for continuous feedback on existing code.
% Approach: What was done that unveiled new knowledge?
We present a concept which aims for helping developers to continuously give feedback on their source code directly in the integrated development environment (IDE) by using the metaphor of social networks. 
% Knowledge: What new facts were uncovered? If the research was not results oriented, what new capabilities are enabled by the work?
This reduces context switches for developers, improves the software development process and allows to give feedback to developers of external libraries and frameworks.
%Grounding: What argument, feasibility proof, artifacts, or results and evaluation support this work?
We conducted a real world case study in the Squeak open source community.
