\section{Background}
\subsection{Code Reviews}
Code reviews range from very informal (e.g., pair programming~\cite{beck2000extreme}) to very formal (e.g., software inspections~\cite{fagan2001design, ackerman1989software}). 
%
Convergent peer reviews are predominantly lightweight, flexible processes, that happen early, quickly and frequently~\cite{rigby2013PeerCodeReviews, shimagaki2016CRInSony, rigby2012contemporary, rigby2014PeerReviewOSS, Sadowski2018Google}. 
%
Therefore, we refer to code reviews as informal peer reviews.
%

%
Currently the main activity of reviews changes from defect finding to discussions about alternative solutions and long-term code maintainability~\cite{rigby2013PeerCodeReviews, czerwonka2015codereviews}.
%
Only about 15\% of the peer review comments point out possible defect while 50\% address code quality~\cite{czerwonka2015codereviews}.
%
Non-technical factors, such as reviewer load and activity, author experience, and the company structure, significantly impact the review outcome~\cite{baysal2013influence, baysal2016investigating}.

%
One challenge developers face during code reviews is context switching, because they have to understand another issue and stop doing their current work~\cite{czerwonka2015codereviews, kononenko2016codereviewquality}.
%
Switching from one problem space to another reduces developers' productivity and should be avoided~\cite{poppendieck2003lean}. 

\subsection{Social Coding}
Social coding is the community-based development of software.
%
Social coding sites, such as GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com}} and BitBucket\footnote{\url{https://bitbucket.org}}, enable substantially more collaborations among developers \cite{thung2013github} and shift the focus of interactions to individual contributors and their activities with electronic artifacts~\cite{dabbish2012social, storey2012msr}.
%
Therefore, social coding is a new and promising approach for improving the software development process by encouraging the collaborations in the team.

\subsection{Live Programming}
