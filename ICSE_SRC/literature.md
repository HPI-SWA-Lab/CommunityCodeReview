## Code Quality

- code ownership correlates with code quality \cite{greiler2015codeownership, bird2011codeownership, foucault2014codeownership, rahman2011ownership}

## Code Reviews
- code review coverage and review participation share a significant link with software quality.\cite{mcintosh2014impact}
- 72.8 percent of the code lines were watched in the first 30 percent
of the review time. \cite{uwano2006analyzing}
- the longer a reviewer scanned the code, the more efficiently the reviewer could find the defect in the code review \cite{uwano2006analyzing}
- Peer code review, a manual inspection of source code by developers other than the author, is recognized as a valuable tool for reducing software defects and improving the quality of software projects \cite{ackerman1989software}
- Motivations are: finding defects, code improvements, alternative solutions, knowedge transfer, team awareness\cite{bacchelli2013expectations}
- Most of the comments are in the categories code improvements, understandability, social communication and defects. \cite{bacchelli2013expectations}
